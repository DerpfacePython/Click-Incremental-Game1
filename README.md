# Ways to NOT make money
A basic Python 2.7.9 Cookie-Clicker style (incremental) game. If anyone can help me edit the game, please message me so I can add you as a collaborator!

Also, if you have downloaded this game and find any bugs, please post them to the 'issues' page (the exclamation mark on the right-hand side of the browser). Thanks!

NOTE: This game currently requires the user to download Python to run. An executable file will be posted sometime in the future!
