# Ways to NOT make money
A basic Python 2.7.9 Cookie-Clicker style (incremental) game. If anyone can help me edit the game, please post an issue telling me to add you, and I will add you (once I have added you, please close the issue)!

Also, if you have downloaded this game and find any bugs, please post them to the 'issues' page (the exclamation mark on the right-hand side of the browser). Thanks!

NOTE: This game currently requires the user to download Python to run. An executable file will be posted sometime in the future!
