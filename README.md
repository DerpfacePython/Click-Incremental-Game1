# Ways to NOT make money
###A basic Python 2.x/3.x Cookie-Clicker style (incremental) game.

For the Python 2 version, go to the py2 folder, and run `game.py`.

For the Python 3 version, go to the py3 folder, and run `game.py`.

For the executable version (AKA "You're too lazy and/or you don't want to look at code"): go to the exe folder.

~~All folders contain the latest version of the game, **V0.7.1**~~ Python 2 and Python 3 ***diverged***. We are trying to restore them by implementing Py2 into Py3 and Py3 into Py2. Currently, Py2 is 2.0.7.2a1 and Py3 is 3.0.7.2a2 although they have no relationship.

IMPORTANT: Py2 and Py3 folders are pure Python. exe.0.7.1 and single-file-executable.0.7.1 are (almost) pure Tcl.
