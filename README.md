# Ways to NOT make money
###A basic Python 2.x/3.x Cookie-Clicker style (incremental) game.
###The latest version is 0.7.3.

For the Python (2.x/3.x) version, you can go to game.py.

For the executable version (AKA "You're too lazy and/or you don't want to look at code"): go to exe.zip (requirements pre-downloaded) or sfexe.zip (requirements not there, downloaded with exe in there).

If you want to chat about stuff relating to the game with us, come to our freenode chat at [webchat.freenode.net](http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=waystonotmakemoney) at #waystonotmakemoney.

If the things you want to talk about are more technical, you can do one of two things (depending on what you want to talk about):
  - If you want to report a bug or have a full-fledged idea, create a new issue.
  - If you have an idea you really want to see (but don't really have much), you can go on the community idea page (which is also an issue).
