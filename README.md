# Ways to NOT make money
###A basic Python 2.x/3.x Cookie-Clicker style (incremental) game.

For the Python 2 version, go to the py2 folder, and run `game.py`. Same goes for Python 3 (except you go to the py3 folder).

For the executable version (AKA "You're too lazy and/or you don't want to look at code"): go to the exe folder.

Python 2 and Python 3 ***diverged***. We are trying to restore them by implementing Py2 into Py3 and Py3 into Py2. Currently, Py2 is 2.0.7.2a1 and Py3 is 3.0.7.2a2 although they have no relationship.

IMPORTANT: Py2 and Py3 folders are pure Python. exe.0.7.1 and single-file-executable.0.7.1 are (almost) pure Tcl.

If you want to chat about stuff relating to the game with us, come to our freenode chat at [webchat.freenode.net](webchat.freenode.net) at #waystonotmakemoney.

If the things you want to talk about are more technical, you can do one of two things (depending on what you want to talk about):
  - If you want to report a bug or have a full-fledged idea, create a new issue.
  - If you have an idea you really want to see (but don't really have much), you can go on the community idea page (which is also an issue).
