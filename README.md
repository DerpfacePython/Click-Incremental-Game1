# Ways to NOT make money
A basic Python 2.7.9 Cookie-Clicker style (incremental) game. If anyone can help me edit the game, please do so!

NOTE: This game currently requires the user to download Python to run. An executable file will be posted sometime in the future!

Line Amount: 260 lines (and counting!)

Version: 0.2-2 (fixes required)

Updates:
    
    0.1.1: Changed from pack and grid to only grid, saving space and making the whole code work
    
    0.1.2: Added placeholders for the Tkinter window.
    
    0.1.3: Fixed a bug in which some labels and buttons don't update.
    
    0.2*: Added a save system (which needs fixing!), and a new building: Counterfeit Company (Costs $9001, Upgrade costs $2133748).
    
    0.2-1*: Changed the save system so that it included an extrenal savefile.
