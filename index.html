<p>Changelog:</p>

<pre><code> 0.6.1-alpha:
        -MAJOR UPDATE!
        -Improved the "cannot affords" and "no requirements", changing the sign to a label that appears in the same place instead of a pop-up window (because those are annoying).
        -Added "million" things to prices (which is great!)

 0.6.0-3:
        -Added bells to "cannot affords" and "no requirements".
        -Fixed more bugs (qlstudio edit this, I have no idea what else you fixed).

 0.6.0-2:
        -Fixed a variety of bugs (thanks qlstudio).
            -Fixed the OverflowError for the buildings themselves
            -Checked for conflict with all the "-illion"'s, no conflict (so far).

 0.6.0-1:
        -Further added to the "million", creating "billion" to "quintillion", which should delay the OverflowError further (most annoying error so far).
        -Fixed the "million", and now there should be no conflict.

 0.6.0:
        -Implemented a "millions" thing, which should prevent (or at least delay) the OverflowError

        -Doubled Chance of finding Gold.
        -Working on a Stats Menu.

 0.5.1:
