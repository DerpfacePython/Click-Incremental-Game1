<p>For the Python 2 version, go to gamePy2.py. Same goes for the Python 3 version, except you go to gamePy3.py.</p>

<p>For the executable version (AKA "You're too lazy and/or you don't want to look at code"): go to exe.zip.</p>

<p><del>Python 2 and Python 3 <strong><em>diverged</em></strong>. We are trying to restore them by implementing Py2 into Py3 and Py3 into Py2. Currently, Py2 is 2.0.7.2a1 and Py3 is 3.0.7.2a2 although they have no relationship.</del> YIPPEE! Currently both Py2 and Py3 are 0.7.3</p>

<p>If you want to chat about stuff relating to the game with us, come to our freenode chat at <a href="http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=waystonotmakemoney">webchat.freenode.net</a> at #waystonotmakemoney.</p>
