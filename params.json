  "body": "# Ways to NOT make money\r\n###A basic Python 2.x/3.x Cookie-Clicker style (incremental) game.\r\n\r\nFor the Python 2 version, go to gamePy2.py. Same goes for the Python 3 version, except you go to gamePy3.py.\r\n\r\nFor the executable version (AKA \"You're too lazy and/or you don't want to look at code\"): go to exe.zip.\r\n\r\n~~Python 2 and Python 3 ***diverged***. We are trying to restore them by implementing Py2 into Py3 and Py3 into Py2. Currently, Py2 is 2.0.7.2a1 and Py3 is 3.0.7.2a2 although they have no relationship.~~ YIPPEE! Currently both Py2 and Py3 are 0.7.3\r\n\r\nIf you want to chat about stuff relating to the game with us, come to our freenode chat at [webchat.freenode.net](http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=waystonotmakemoney) at #waystonotmakemoney.\r\n\r\nIf the things you want to talk about are more technical, you can do one of two things (depending on what you want to talk about):\r\n  - If you want to report a bug or have a full-fledged idea, create a new issue.\r\n  - If you have an idea you really want to see (but don't really have much), you can go on the community idea page (which is also an issue).\r\n",
